**JEETARDS WIKI**
*The official WIKI and repo of the JEEtardsWiki*

ABOUT :
This wiki is made for the students preparing for JEE students to help in their preparation journey. (I was a JEE student too but failed lol). Get important notifications, guides, materials from all of the internet in a single place. Let's not waste time searching for resources. You got better things to do. 

CONTRIBUTING: For those interested to contribute/update, you can either directly commit to the existing files or place your contro in the helping.md page.You can also suggest some features in the suggestion.md page. Just place your links with some heading and description, that's all. ME or someone a little techy will do the needful. 

> Limitations: Well, the jeetardswiki.netlify.app might not always be up on the web for a week in a month if coz i got no money and limited bandwidth. Solution is to wait for the next month and the bandwidth refreshes or help me run the site by paying a chaisutta amount.

> Anybody willing to take over this project is free to mail me coz this is the end of my JEE materials sharing journey. Adios!

LOVE YOU ALL
ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR UPCOMING JOURNEY
