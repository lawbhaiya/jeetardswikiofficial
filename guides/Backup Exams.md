Well folks, most of you will have your "chud gye guru" moment. You might give your first mains exam and could not score good enough and start contemplating your life decisions. But hold on, JEE is not the only way to get a good engineering college. It is better to have a backup plan/exam. Well, you might think that IIT was my dream but let me tell you " Life is unfair and Reality sucks". <br>
You all gotta have a realistic goal which is a good engineering college. Before its too late, I present some backup exams to help you achieve that realistic goal:<br>

==- LIFE SAVER EXAMS
1. **BITSAT** - The enginneering exam conducted to get into Bits Pilani, Bits Goa and . <BR>
2. **UGEE** - It's the admission test for 5 year integrated B.Tech + MS degrees at the one and only IIITH.  Around 800 people are shortlisted from written exam for an interview after which you get a rank that decides if you get in or not. Probably the easiest way to get into IIITH. No caste reservation, female reservation applies.<br>
3. **COMEDK** - This is for admission to the engineering colleges in Karnataka like RVCE,etc.<br>
4. **ISI** -  ISI stands for Indian Statistical Institute. It's the best institute in India for studying statistics (basically making a career in data science).<br>
5.  **IAT** - This is the admission test to IISERs which are the best research institutes in India after IISc for science, tho IISc also accepts IAT now. Definitely worth trying if you're interested in pursuing a degree in pure sciences.<br>
6. **NEST** - It is the entrance exam for NISER. NISER is a great research institute like IISERs.<br>
7. **IPMAT** -  This isn't for admission to engineering colleges but hear me out. You get into integrated BBA+MBA at IIM Indore or Rohtak through this. Both of them have separate IPMAT afaik. <br>
8. **STATE ENGINEERING EXAMS** - Just like Jee, each state conduct its own set of engineering exams. The most popular ones include WBJEE, MHTCET, GUJCET, KCET, etc.<br>
9. **CUET** - The enginnering exam to take admission in central universities and some private institutions.<br>
10. **Manipal entrance exam** <br>
12. **VITEE**<br>
