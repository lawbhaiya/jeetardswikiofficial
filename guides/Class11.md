**A NEW CHAPTER** <br>
Congratulations junior. You have completed Level 1 of your life and are now about to enter Level 2. A new level is supposed to be hard and I assure you it is hard. How much hard, you ask? Well, be patient and time will answer all your questions. So, now before moving to Level 2 let us first get familiar with the game coz I believe " The major difference between an achiever and a failure is lack of Awareness". "Awareness combined with execution is the key for success". <br>
Your reason for deciding this exam could be anything and you now have to make the most out of it. With that of my chest, lets start early. <br>
- Your class 10 marks don't matter shit except for satisfying your parents demand of "prodigy beta/beti". Every one of you starting now are equal and have equal chances of break/make this exam. A below average kid could pull high ranks if he/she is dedicated enough. 
- Should i join a dummy school? Most of your parents might not be willing to send you to a dummy school but that's fine as long as you can manage. But if you have a choice to get enrolled in a good coaching institute and is confident to regularly attend them dummy school is your final call. 
> Consulation with parents and seniors are necessary to make a final call. 
- Which coaching? Any reputed coaching (present reviews should be good), affordable and good location wise for you to be adjust comortably.
- Study hours? Be attentive in your class/coaching and a good self study session back home is enough. No 14-16 hrs bullshit. Take a chill pill and enjoy what you are learning on a daily basis.
- Ghar se preparation possible hai? Yes, it is 100% doable but you gotta be disciplined enough to sit at your study desk first. <Read More>
- Kya book padhu? For starters, coaching modules are enough. But want some more practise problems, you could checkout these recommended books <here>
- Kaha se padhu? Well, most of the students being enrolled in a good coaching centre would learn from Youtube/Online platform back at home. So --check out these--
- Hours per subject? A balanced time slot for all subjects but remember to give extra hours to the weak subject.
- Mains ya Advanced k liye direct padhu? Start studying first and you will eventually get to know your capability but remember to not get demotivated and always push forward.
- Social Media tyaag karu? It totally depends upon you. If you feel like you could be more focussed after quitting social media, go for it or else few hours on social media is fine. Seniors say: "Quit social media but donot quit socializing."
- Backlogs? This is bound to happen. The only solution is either staying ahead of your teachers or attend classes regularly. Keep backlogs to a low count to avoid future stress. --Check this out-- 
- Pyqs or xyz books? Solving pyqs are the first thing to do after your modules coz it will give you an idea about the question types and difficulty. Then switch to xyz books but donot waste much time on that. <br>

Damn, already reached Shibuya. Well time for a goodbye till next year. Good luck on your jeerney.
