**FINALLY WOKE UP**<br><br>
Took a year for you to realise that a year passed away. Already thinking you are cooked? Worry not but how could you not worry. Anyways, greetings. There could be infinite reasons for you to not start your JEE prep in class 11 or slack off after being enrolled in a coaching institute or in an online platform. Whatever be the case, we got you covered. 

Is it still possible for us to ace JEE? Yes absolutely. But it will take a good amount of dedication and effort. You all are and should be familiar with the basics: good coaching/online platform, module practise, pyq solving, mock tests and analysing, less backlogs, consistency, etc. But there are certains questions/ advices that we would like to answer/share:
<br>

- Jee or Boards? Nobody knows the exact answer. You yourself have to figure it out. Ask yourself about your current study status, willing to push past limits, could manage boards, any good reason to appear for Jee, etc. You are smart enough to not fool yourself.
- Managing Boards and JEE: Focus on covering your 12th syllabus very well and every extra time you get cover up 11th chapters. Figure out easy/moderate/hard chapters of both standards and allot time accordingly. Time to utilize time homie. 
- A very serious advice ---> Donot fuck up your 12th boards. You donot want yourself to get stressed about reexams or improvement exams. Also, a decent 12th score opens up good college opportunities and uplifts your's parents trust in you. 
- Prepare class 12 chapters very well coz some state entrance exams have greater 12 syllabus.
- For study resources, check out the wiki and you will get most of them.

For folks, that have wasted 11th due to infinte reasons, wanna waste 12th too? The competition is tight so act fast to not get crumbled. You know your mistakes very well and the areas you can improve on, work on that. Coaching not good, then drop out and self study or vice versa. Decide man now. You don't wanna take a drop year, i tell you the experience is not too good. Make an action plan fast and act on it. <BR>
