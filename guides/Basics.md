+++REVISION


Revision is a crucial element in your JEE prep journey. You are about to learn 60-70 chapters but you will definetely forget each chapter the next week, haha. That is where revision fits in. The main difference between a high scorer and you is that he retains information for a good period of time while you forget what you learnt very quickly. There are some good and tried tested ways of revision which you already know but never implement. It's about time boy.<br>

- SPACED REPETITION : A method where you try to revise a topic/subject with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is presented or said.  If you are able to recall the information correctly double the time to recall in the future. <BR>
- ACTIVE RECALL : After completing your daily revision, try to remember whatever you have learnt by covering your notes or taking a simple test.<br>
- FUNNELLING : Completed a chapter, try to summarise each concept into a single sheet.
- FENYMAN TECHNIQUE - Act like a teacher and try to explain as if a child is listening. If you could simply the topics, you have understood it clearly.

+++NOTE-MAKING


Note-making is a handy technique to help you prepare better be it whatever exams. From the POV of JEE, it is highly recommended. From making mind maps, short notes, writing maths formulas, making mnemonics, etc it helps you retain the subject better. Caution though, your offline coachings will make you write ample notes each day but its upto you to make better use of it.<br>

FULL CHAPTER NOTES: If you are enrolled in any coaching or even studying online, you would be writing full chapter notes just for the sake of it. The only suggestion here is that you understand properly before jotting down and revise it the same day to get a grasp of that day's lectures.<br>

SHORT NOTES: These notes are the real deal. You gotta make them after completing + revising a chapter with a concentrated mind. You gotta make short notes for the required chapters (all chapters not necesssarily) which should be concise, to the point, easy to read and access and presentable ( a bare minimum atleast). Helps you to easily go through a chapter in a short time and revising before mocks/tests.<br>
You could easily get best notes from the internet but if you got enough time, make your own please. <br>

DAILY SHORT NOTES: Each day you are gonna learn a topic so make daily short notes. Remember the notes would prove beneficial if you make it at the time of self study.

+++RTI

**Wanna get some information regarding your preferred college ( placement stats, companies visited, etc), the most useful solution is filing an RTI.**

*STEPS TO FILE AN RTI* <BR>

1) The site to file - https://rtionline.gov.in (for central government) https://rtionline.delhi.gov.in (For Delhi Government) and others, as such. Google for each state's RTI link. Some states do not have online facility so have to send by post.<br>
2) Read FAQ of the site for online process. For Offline postal process, refer pinned post in my profile.<br>

> RS 10 is required for each request.<br>

*Questions that you can ask:*<br>

1) Provide the branch-wise average(CS, ECE and all other branches separately), median, highest and lowest CTC offered to students of UG Engineering in placement seasons of 2021-22 and 2022-23.<br>

2) Provide a branchwise table of NUMBER of registered students versus placed students for UG Engineering in seasons of 2021-22 and 2022-23<br>

3) Provide the number of branchwise internationally placed students of UG Engineering in seasons of 2021-22 and 2022-23 (till date) and provide the median and(or) average of said placements.<br>

4) Provide the institute-wide overall average and median CTC offered to UG Engineering students in seasons of 2021-22 and 2022-23 (till date)<br>

Now the above, you will get data for 95% OF THE COLLEGES.<br>

IIT Kharagpur maintains raw data. Use this Question stream -<br>

Provide certified copies of placement data in the following format -<br>
Branch of the Student [UG] versus CTC received for each student. Name of Student and other information may be hidden as per Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, 2005. Scanned copies of the document to be sent via email and the hard copies to be provided at the postal address.<br>

>As per above, the CPIO/SPIO may ask for Rs. 2/per page and(or) reject the request under provisions in the RTI Act, 200<br>
