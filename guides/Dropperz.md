Decided to take a drop, huh? Are you sure about that? Are you sure you could pull this off? Coz, let me remind you, it is gonna be tough. Think about this decision wisely right now. You don't wanna regret it. <br>
Now, that you have made up your mind lets continue. <BR>
- Be clear about the reason of you taking a drop year.
- Analyse your mistakes before jumping on studying: Just analyse what went wrong less prep,a weak subject, less mocks, inconsistency, luck or something else. Got your answer. Time to work on it.
- Setting up a realistic goal: Yeah it is very important. By now you have realised your potential and mistakes you made. so it is time to have realistic goals. Like you could decide whether you wanna give jee mains only or give advanced too. 
- Backup Plans: It is highly recommended to keep a backup plan at this point. The plan could be anything like other engineering exams or outside of the science stream. 
- Online v/s Offline : During the past 2 years you must have figured out what works for you. So, stick to that. [Read More](https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1e70yj5/confused_between_offline_or_online_prep_for_jee/)
- Quitting Social media: Social media is gonna waste your precious time, so either quit it totally or keep the usage very minimal.
- For the online study gang, find a reliable platform and teachers and follow them religiously. Donoot waste energy switching teachers and  please donot follow bhaiya/didis.
- PYQs are a must and don't avoid question solving at all costs. Make a daily target for each subject. 
- Coaching tests are a must even if your syllabus isn't done. Give mocks of good institutes regularly.
- Subject wise strategy: Eveybody knows Chemistry is the life saver and NCERT is a must. Maths is all about practise and figuring out the dots. A little love for Physics will help you clear it.
- Do not waste crucial time for going too deep into a chapter just because you could solve the chapter. Do not be a perfectionist. Remember syllabus coverage should be your priority.
- Proper Revision is the ultimate factor for your progress.
- Make a spreadsheet to visualize which subjects/strengths are your strength or weakness. Also track your daily progress in a spreadsheet. --get one here--
- Find a dropper study group to keep you sane and have someone to talk to.
